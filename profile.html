    <h3>Interests:</h3>
    	<p>
				My current interests are mostly food-based and include curating recipes, food photography and styling. Although it may sound trivial, grocery shopping is one of the things I look forward to every week. 
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		On my downtime, I enjoy binging on television shows such as Downton Abbey, Breaking Bad and Sopranos. Twitter Spaces is also a new love of mine. I enjoy listening to tech experts who transitioned to the industry (i.e engineers, product managers etc) and gaining insight from them. 
    	</p>

    <h3>Career Goals:</h3>
    	<p>
				My goal is to become a software engineer. I took a CS class in college and absolutely loved the problem solving aspect of it, albeit frustrating at times but I knew it was something I wanted to do in the future.
    <br>
    <br>
			Post college and valuable work experience, I'm looking forward to becoming a subject matter expert in JavaScript while also leveraging my data analytics skills, working on projects that provide value and mentoring aspiring engineers
